Act as a Senior Product Manager. Take the attached draft-spec.md and convert it into a formal Functional Specification.

Structure it as:

Summary: High-level value proposition.

User Stories: As a [user], I want [action], so that [benefit].

Functional Logic: Detailed rules for how the system handles dates, completion triggers, and recurrence calculations.

Edge Cases: Explicitly define what happens during 'unhappy paths' (e.g., time zones, leap years, user un-completing a task).

Focus strictly on business logic (the 'What'), not database schemas or UI code.

Write the output in a file named feature-spec-1.md
