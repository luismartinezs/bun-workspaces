You are a Lead Business Analyst. I am handing you this draft-spec.md. Your goal is to write a spec, but the draft is currently too vague.

Do not write the spec yet. Instead, analyze the draft and identify the top 5 logical gaps or ambiguities that would cause a developer to get stuck. Output these as 5 specific questions. Once I answer them (or you propose a logical default), then we will write the spec.

For now, just list the logical holes regarding state changes and date math.

Write the output in a file named feature-spec-3.md
