"Convert the attached draft-spec.md into a Product Requirements Document focused on User Intent.

Instead of just listing features, define the Rules of Engagement:

Trigger: What exactly causes the recurrence to calculate? (Is it the arrival of the date, or the completion of the previous item?)

Constraint: What prevents 'task piling'? Define the logic for 'Max Active Instances'.

State Diagram Description: Describe verbally how a task moves from 'Pending' -> 'Overdue' -> 'Completed' -> 'New Instance Created'.

Be extremely precise about the difference between 'Absolute Recurrence' (Calendar-based) and 'Relative Recurrence' (Completion-based).

Write the output in a file named feature-spec-4.md
