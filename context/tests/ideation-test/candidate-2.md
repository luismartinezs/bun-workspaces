I need to turn this rough idea into a set of strict behavioral rules for my engineering team. Take the draft-spec.md and output a Gherkin Feature File (Given/When/Then syntax).

Create scenarios for:

The 'Happy Path' (completing on time).

The 'Late Completion' path (completing 3 days late -> calculation of next date).

The 'Accumulation' path (ignoring a daily task for a week).

Ensure the logic is unambiguous so a QA engineer could write automated tests against it.

Write the output in a file named feature-spec-2.md
